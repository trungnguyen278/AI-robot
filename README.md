# ai-robot

> **Status:** early development — the Raspberry Pi software skeleton runs against simulated hardware and already drives the robot's face, drawn in a web browser; no hardware has been built yet.

A mobile AI robot on a tracked chassis, with **two arms**, a **2-DOF neck** carrying a 7" display as an expressive face, voice interaction, and an AI camera.

- **Brain:** Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) — audio, vision, face, AI and networking (built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE).
- **Body:** a microcontroller for real-time control of servos, motors and encoders, sensors and LEDs — not chosen yet (concept v0 shows an ESP32-S3; [ADR-0004](docs/decisions/0004-pi-software-first.md)). Until then the body is simulated.
- **Software:** ROS 2 Lyrical (LTS) on Ubuntu 26.04 LTS. Every module is a ROS 2 node, and the body is reached through ros2_control ([ADR-0017](docs/decisions/0017-ros-2.md); today's code still runs as one Python process).

*Concept v0 — a quick sketch (labels in Vietnamese); the arm design may still change.*

## What it should do

A first outline of the product, not a specification: details and priorities are settled along the way. More ideas and notes: [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md).

- **Talk:** a wake word, spoken conversation with an AI assistant, and being interrupted while it speaks.
- **Express:** animated eyes and emotions on the face display; full-screen scenes for everyday information (time, weather, timers, reminders, music); status screens (start-up, connection, updates, battery); touch input, and interactive screens such as settings, opened by a tap or by voice.
- **See:** notice people, faces and objects with the camera, and show the AI what it sees.
- **Move:** drive on its tracks while avoiding obstacles, turn its head towards people, gesture with its arms, perhaps pick up light objects.
- **Sense:** obstacles ahead and the battery level, with more sensors as the need arises.
- **Connect:** Wi-Fi for the AI service and for software updates; set-up and settings on the robot's own touch screen, or from a phone app over Bluetooth LE, which also handles remote control.
- **Stay safe:** an emergency stop, a safe stop if the software hangs, status lights, and a clean shutdown before the battery runs out.

Each folder is an independent component with its own README; see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-or-removing-a-component) for how to add or remove one.

`platform/` is a git submodule: clone with `git clone --recurse-submodules`, or run `git submodule update --init` after a plain clone.
