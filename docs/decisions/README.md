# Architecture decision records (ADRs)

Each significant decision is a short file: context, decision, alternatives considered and consequences — so that years from now we still know **why**.

- Template: [0000-template.md](0000-template.md). How to write one: the `adr` checklist (`.claude/skills/adr/SKILL.md`).
- Never edit an old ADR to change a decision; write a new one and mark the old one "Superseded by …".
- From 2026-10-28, a decision that spans the project's repositories (a protocol between them, identity, languages) is recorded in [ai-platform](https://github.com/trungnguyen278/ai-platform/tree/main/docs/decisions) ([ai-platform ADR-0001](https://github.com/trungnguyen278/ai-platform/blob/main/docs/decisions/0001-repositories.md)); the robot's own decisions stay here.
