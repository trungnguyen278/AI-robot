## Commonly used header pins

| Function | GPIO (physical pin) | Notes |

| UART0 | 14 TX (8), 15 RX (10) | Full PL011 UART; the console lives on the separate debug connector. Enabled with the `uart0-pi5` overlay, present in Raspberry Pi OS's and Ubuntu 26.04's kernels (checked 2026-10-28) |
| I2S / PCM | 18 BCLK (12), 19 LRCLK (35), 20 DIN (38), 21 DOUT (40) | **The only I2S pin group on the header**; enable with `dtparam=i2s=on` or the HAT's overlay |
| Hardware PWM | 12, 13, 18, 19 | 18/19 overlap with I2S |
| SPI0 | 7–11 | Enable with `dtparam=spi=on` |

## Power

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Recommended supply | 5 V / 5 A USB-C PD (27 W) | Product brief |
| USB current limit | 3 A supply → ~600 mA total for all USB ports; 5 A PD supply → ~1.6 A | White paper RP-009856 |
| Lifting the limit | `usb_max_current_enable=1` (`config.txt`) or `PSU_MAX_CURRENT=5000` (EEPROM, `sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit`) — only with a genuine 5 A supply | Secondary sources (Waveshare, forums) |
| Powered through the 5 V header pins | No PD negotiation → likely treated as a supply below 5 A | Inference — to be tested |
| Measured power draw | ~3 W idle (headless, Wi-Fi); ~8.8–9.8 W at full CPU load; 12–16 W with NVMe, video or accelerators | raspberry.tips; Jeff Geerling |
| When halted | ~1.2–1.6 W by default; `POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1` (EEPROM) → ~0.01 W, may upset some HATs | Jeff Geerling |

## Thermals

- Soft throttling starts around 80 °C and hard throttling around 85 °C. *(secondary sources)*
- Active Cooler fan curve: 0 % below 50 °C → 30 % at 50 °C → 50 % at 60 °C → 70 % at 67.5 °C → 100 % at 75 °C, with 5 °C hysteresis. *(secondary sources)* In a 52Pi test it held the CPU around 60 °C at full load.

## Software

- **OS:** Ubuntu 26.04 LTS Server, 64-bit, chosen in [ADR-0017](../../docs/decisions/0017-ros-2.md) for ROS 2. Canonical certifies it on the Pi 5, which needs a bootloader EEPROM dated 2025-02-11 or later. A March 2026 Ubuntu bug report adds that 2025-12-08 is known to work, so update the EEPROM to the latest before installing.
- **Raspberry Pi OS**, the vendor's own: 64-bit, based on Debian 13 "Trixie" (latest image seen: 2026-04-21, kernel 6.12).
  - Its Pi 5 kernel (`kernel_2712.img`) uses 16 KB memory pages: `getconf PAGESIZE` gives 16384 on the robot's Pi, measured 2026-10-28.
  - Some software costs much more under 16 KB pages: each ROS 2 Python process carries a 128 MB region from LTTng-UST ([ADR-0017](../../docs/decisions/0017-ros-2.md)). `kernel8.img`, shipped beside it, uses 4 KB pages *(secondary source)*, as Ubuntu's kernel does.
- **GPIO:** `RPi.GPIO` **does not work** on the Pi 5 (GPIO lives on the RP1). Use `gpiozero` (with the `lgpio` backend), `lgpio` or `libgpiod`; `rpi-lgpio` runs legacy RPi.GPIO code.
- **gpiochip numbering:** the header used to be `gpiochip4`; newer kernels add a `gpiochip0` alias → never hard-code it, use `gpiodetect`/`gpioinfo`.
- **Camera:** libcamera, Picamera2, rpicam-apps. On Ubuntu, libcamera and rpicam-apps come from Ubuntu's archive, but Picamera2 and the IMX500's firmware do not ([AI Camera notes](raspberry-pi-ai-camera.md)).

## Checked on the robot's Pi

Measured on 2026-10-28, under Raspberry Pi OS:
- **The board:** Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.1, revision code `d04171` (8 GB), with the BCM2712's D0 stepping: the firmware loads its `bcm2712d0` overlay. Its bootloader EEPROM is dated 2025-12-08.
- **Bluetooth:** HCI version 9 (Bluetooth 5.0), with LE, advertising (5 sets), secure connections and privacy; both the central and the peripheral roles.
- **Overlays the robot needs:** all present, in Raspberry Pi OS and in Ubuntu 26.04's kernel alike: `tpm-slb9670`, `uart0-pi5`, `uart2-pi5`, `spi0-1cs`, `i2c1`, `vc4-kms-dsi-waveshare-panel`, `imx500`.
- **Power, on Raspberry Pi's official 27 W supply:**
  - the Pi received no USB-PD offer at boot: `usbpd_power_data_objects` is empty;
  - so it assumed 3 A (`max_current` 3000 mA) and holds its USB ports to about 600 mA (`usb_max_current_enable=0`), too little for the XVF3800 array at volume ([hardware open issue 10](../README.md));
  - the official supply should offer 5.1 V at 5 A. To check: a power cycle, and the plug and cable between the two.

## AI performance (estimates, see ADR-0001)

- Theoretical memory bandwidth is ~17 GB/s (LPDDR4X-4267 on a 32-bit bus), so local LLMs run at roughly 1.5–2 tokens/s for 7–8B models, 4–6 tokens/s for 3B and 8–12 tokens/s for 1.5B. Community figures, not measured here.

## Notes for this robot

- Powered from the 5 V DC-DC through the header → see Power; never power servos or motors from the Pi's 5 V rail.
- A metal chassis can weaken Wi-Fi → fallback: a USB Wi-Fi adapter with an external antenna.
- Sudden power loss can corrupt the SD card → shut down cleanly on low battery; consider a read-only/overlay root filesystem or NVMe.
