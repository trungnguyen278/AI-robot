"""A session of the control channel (platform/protocols/cloud/README.md, Resuming a
session).

A session runs from the cloud's ``hello`` that opens it to a ``bye``, across as many
connections as it needs. It numbers what the robot sends, and keeps it until the cloud
has received it, so that the next connection can send it again. It takes the cloud's
messages once each and in order, at the rate the robot allows, and answers them.
