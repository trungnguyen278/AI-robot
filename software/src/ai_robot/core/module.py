    - Its settings, the ``[modules.<name>]`` table, arrive as keyword arguments of
      ``__init__``, which raises ``ValueError`` for an invalid value.

    Once every adapter is open, the application calls ``start`` on each module in
    configuration order, then runs every module's ``run`` concurrently. When the robot
    stops, it cancels ``run`` and calls ``stop`` in reverse order, only for modules whose
    ``start`` succeeded. Subscribe to messages in ``__init__``, so that none published
    while the other modules start is missed.
