    """Listens and talks: it holds the robot's conversations with the cloud
    (docs/decisions/0018).

    - **Opening.** A wake word opens a conversation, if the cloud takes them. If it does
      not, or the conversation cannot start, the face shows ``offline_expression`` for
      ``offline_seconds``: the robot's cue, without words. The cloud may open one too,
      to listen or only to talk; a wake word ends one that does not listen, and opens
      another.
    - **Listening.** The robot streams what it hears for the whole conversation, the
      face showing it. Unless the microphones cancel the echo of what the robot plays
      (``echo_cancelled``, a voice processor's), it streams nothing while it speaks.
    - **Turns** are the cloud's: the face shows when the user speaks, when the robot
      thinks and when it speaks, and that it is attentive between turns.
    - **Answers** play as they come. With the echo cancelled, ``barge_in`` seconds of
      voice over an answer stop it at once, and the cloud hears of it; it already has
      the words.
    - **Limits.** The robot ends a conversation after ``nothing_heard`` seconds without
      voice from its opening, as after a false wake; after ``idle`` seconds in which
      nobody speaks to it and it does not speak; after ``longest`` seconds; and when its
      microphones go off. Speech the cloud drops as not meant for the robot counts as
      silence.
    - **Voice** is a window whose probability of voice reaches ``voice_threshold``.
      Durations are measured in the audio heard, to the byte, not on a clock.

    It publishes where the conversation is (``InteractionChanged``), and the loudness
    of what the microphones hear (``SoundLevel``).

    **Settings** (docs/decisions/0016): the ``volume`` of the robot's voice, in percent;
    whether the ``microphones`` are on (off, the robot hears nothing, and the screen
    says so: ``MicrophonesChanged``, PRIV-1); and ``idle``, which trades privacy for
    ease, from ``idle_least`` to ``idle_most`` seconds.
