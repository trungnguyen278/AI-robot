/* The renderer's settings: how the face changes, stays alive and responds, in one
   place, so that tuning it means editing this file only.

   Not here:
   - the face's shapes, motions and colours, and the scenes' drawings: they are content,
     in expressions.js, motions.js, tones.js and scenes/;
   - what the screen protocol fixes (link.js, and the voice's half second of silence in
     animator.js);
   - what the robot decides, such as when the battery is low: the software sends it. */
